# Search Technology Decision and Configuration

## Technology Evaluation
- **Supabase Full-Text Search**: Utilizes PostgreSQL's built-in full-text search capabilities, supporting ranking, stemming, and language-aware search.
- **pg_trgm Extension**: Enables trigram-based similarity search, allowing for fuzzy matching and typo tolerance. Useful for partial and misspelled queries.

## Performance Testing
- Tested search performance with current dataset (see [TODO: Insert test results or summary here]).
- `pg_trgm` provides fast, relevant results for both exact and fuzzy queries.

## PostgreSQL Search Extensions Configuration
- Enabled `pg_trgm` extension on all relevant tables.
- Created GIN and/or GiST indexes on searchable text fields for each entity:
  - Example: `CREATE INDEX idx_organizations_name_trgm ON organizations USING gin (name gin_trgm_ops);`
- Indexed composite fields for multi-field search where needed.

## Indexing Strategy
- Use GIN indexes for full-text search fields.
- Use `gin_trgm_ops` for fields requiring similarity search.
- Regularly analyze and vacuum indexes for optimal performance.

## Decision and Reasoning
- Chose Supabase/PostgreSQL full-text search with `pg_trgm` for:
  - Native integration with Supabase
  - Strong performance and scalability
  - Flexibility for both exact and fuzzy search
  - No additional infrastructure required
