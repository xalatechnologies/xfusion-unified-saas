# UI Migration & Improvement Checklist

## Overview

This checklist guides the migration and improvement of the current UI design and layout to the new unified SaaS platform architecture. It ensures all existing layouts, components, and flows are transferred, modernized, and enhanced for theming, accessibility, responsiveness, and code quality. The process is atomic, testable, and fully documented.

## 1. Audit & Inventory
- [ ] Audit all current layouts (dashboard, sidebar, topbar, content, footer, etc.)
- [ ] Audit all current UI components (Button, Card, Badge, Table, etc.)
- [ ] Document all user flows and edge cases in the current UI
- [ ] Capture screenshots and visual references for all states and breakpoints
- [ ] Identify any custom styles, hardcoded values, or legacy patterns

## 2. Mapping & Planning
- [ ] Map each current layout/component to its new shared library equivalent
- [ ] Identify gaps or missing variants in the new component library
- [ ] Plan improvements for theming, accessibility, and responsiveness
- [ ] Document migration plan and improvement opportunities for each layout/component

## 3. Refactoring & Migration
- [ ] Refactor each layout to use new shared components and design tokens
- [ ] Replace all custom styles with token-based styling
- [ ] Remove all hardcoded values and legacy CSS/Tailwind
- [ ] Implement missing component variants as needed
- [ ] Ensure all layouts/components support runtime theming and white-labeling
- [ ] Ensure all layouts/components are fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Add/Improve ARIA roles, labels, and keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- [ ] Add/Improve focus indicators and color contrast for accessibility
- [ ] Refactor code to keep all files under 200-300 lines (split as needed)
- [ ] Apply SOLID principles and best practices

## 4. Visual Regression & QA
- [ ] Set up visual regression testing (before/after migration)
- [ ] Compare migrated layouts/components to original screenshots
- [ ] Test all layouts/components on all breakpoints and browsers
- [ ] Test all flows with keyboard and screen readers
- [ ] Run automated accessibility tests (axe, Lighthouse)
- [ ] Collect feedback from users and stakeholders on improvements
- [ ] Iterate and fix any visual, usability, or accessibility issues found

## 5. Documentation & Handover
- [ ] Document all migrated layouts/components and improvements in markdown
- [ ] Update Storybook stories for all migrated components
- [ ] Add before/after visual references to documentation
- [ ] Add troubleshooting and FAQ section for migration issues
- [ ] Announce migration completion and improvements to the team

*All boxes must be checked before UI migration and improvement is considered finalized. This checklist is exhaustive and atomic. Each task should be checked off only when fully complete and verified for design, accessibility, and user experience.*
