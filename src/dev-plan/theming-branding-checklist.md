# Theming & Branding Feature Checklist

## Overview

This feature enables full white-labeling and real-time theming for the SaaS platform. It includes a Theme/Branding Admin Panel for SaaS and organization admins, a DB-driven design token system, and runtime theming for all UI. All changes are persisted, secure, and accessible, supporting both SaaS-level and org-level overrides. The system is foundational for global styling, branding, and accessibility.

---

## 1. Database Schema & Backend
- [ ] Design and document the `design_tokens` table schema (org/saas-level, token_key, token_value, type, enum_key, etc.)
- [ ] Design and document the `design_token_enums` table schema (enum_type, enum_key, enum_value, description)
- [ ] Implement DB migrations for both tables
- [ ] Implement backend logic for org/saas-level token override resolution
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `GET /api/design-tokens?org_id=...` (with fallback logic)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `POST /api/design-tokens` (create/update token)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `DELETE /api/design-tokens/:id` (delete/reset token)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `GET /api/design-token-enums?type=...` (fetch enums)
- [ ] Add authentication and permissions middleware (super-admin/org-admin for write)
- [ ] Add audit logging for all token changes
- [ ] Write unit/integration tests for all endpoints and logic
- [ ] Document API endpoints and expected request/response formats

## 2. Admin UI (Theme/Branding Panel)
- [ ] Restrict panel access to super-admins/org-admins only
- [ ] Build color picker controls for all color tokens (primary, secondary, accent, error, etc.)
- [ ] Build dropdowns for font size enums (initial, smaller, larger, etc.)
- [ ] Build font family selector (from allowed list)
- [ ] Build controls for border radius, border width, shadow, spacing, etc.
- [ ] Add reset-to-default button for each token
- [ ] Implement live preview of app/layouts/components with current token values
- [ ] Ensure changes update preview instantly (before saving)
- [ ] Implement save button to persist changes to DB
- [ ] Show success/error toasts on save
- [ ] Add option to discard changes
- [ ] Implement theme switching (org vs. saas/global preview)
- [ ] Ensure all controls use shared UI components and design tokens
- [ ] Ensure all controls are keyboard and screen reader accessible
- [ ] Add ARIA labels, roles, and descriptions to all controls
- [ ] Ensure all color pickers and dropdowns meet WCAG 2.0 AA contrast
- [ ] Add responsive layout for mobile/tablet/desktop
- [ ] Write unit/integration tests for all UI controls and flows
- [ ] Document all UI components and flows in code and markdown

## 3. Integration with Global Styles & ThemeProvider
- [ ] On login/app load, fetch tokens for current org/saas
- [ ] Inject tokens as CSS variables and JS tokens
- [ ] Update ThemeProvider to use tokens from DB (with fallback to defaults)
- [ ] Support hot-reloading of tokens on change
- [ ] Ensure all shared components consume tokens (no hardcoded styles)
- [ ] Add tests for token loading, fallback, and hot-reload
- [ ] Document integration process for devs

## 4. QA, Testing, and Rollout
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for token CRUD, permissions, and UI controls
- [ ] Ensure all controls are keyboard and screen reader accessible (test with screen reader tools)
- [ ] Run visual regression tests (snapshot previews before/after token changes)
- [ ] Prepare rollout plan (beta with select orgs/admins, then full rollout)
- [ ] Announce and document for all users (release notes, help docs)
- [ ] Add troubleshooting and FAQ section for common theming issues

*All boxes must be checked before Theming & Branding is considered finalized. This checklist is exhaustive and atomic. Each task should be checked off only when fully complete and verified for design, security, accessibility, and user experience.*
