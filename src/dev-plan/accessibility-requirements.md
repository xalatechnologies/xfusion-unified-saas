# Accessibility Requirements for Shared UI Library

## Standards & Guidelines
- **WCAG 2.0 AA**: All components meet or exceed the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 AA for color contrast, text size, and interaction.
- **Universal Design**: Components are designed for all users, including those with disabilities, following universal design principles.

## Touch Targets
- All interactive elements (Button, Switch, Checkbox, etc.) have a minimum touch target of **44x44px**.
- Icon-only and small variants enforce this minimum via CSS and runtime warnings in development.

## Color & Contrast
- All color pairs for text and UI elements meet or exceed **WCAG 2.0 AA** contrast ratios.
- Accessible accent color is used for text where needed.

## Focus Styles
- All interactive elements use a **high-contrast, visible focus style** (`:focus-visible`) with a 2px outline in the primary/accent color.
- Focus styles are universal and cannot be overridden by custom styles.

## ARIA & Screen Reader Support
- All controls have appropriate **ARIA roles, labels, and states**.
- Runtime warnings are shown in development if required ARIA attributes are missing (e.g., icon-only buttons without `aria-label`).
- All states (checked, selected, etc.) are announced by screen readers.

## Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements are **keyboard accessible** (Tab/Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys where appropriate).
- No component traps focus or requires a mouse for operation.

## Responsive Design
- All components use **atomic responsive classes** for padding, width, and font size.
- Table, Card, and Avatar are fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
- All stories in Storybook demonstrate responsive behavior.

## Documentation & Testing
- All requirements are documented in this file and in the `ui-enhancement-checklist.md`.
- Storybook stories cover all variants, accessibility, and responsive states.
- Accessibility is tested with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and color contrast tools.
