# User Management Feature Checklist

## Overview

User Management provides comprehensive tools for SaaS and organization admins to manage users, roles, statuses, passwords, avatars, and exports. It is tightly integrated with the backend API, leverages the shared UI component library, and enforces strict access control, validation, and accessibility. All user management logic, UI, and dialogs are encapsulated for maintainability, scalability, and a seamless admin experience.

---

## 1. Backend & API
- [ ] Design and document the `users` table schema (fields, constraints, org_id, etc.)
- [ ] Implement DB migrations for users and related tables (roles, user_roles, etc.)
- [ ] Implement backend logic for user CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
- [ ] Implement backend logic for user search, filtering, and pagination
- [ ] Implement backend logic for user status changes (activate, deactivate, suspend)
- [ ] Implement backend logic for role assignment and permission checks
- [ ] Implement backend logic for password management (reset, change, hash)
- [ ] Implement backend logic for avatar upload, validation, and storage
- [ ] Implement backend logic for user export (CSV, selected/all fields)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `GET /api/users` (list, search, filter, paginate)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `POST /api/users` (create user)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `PUT /api/users/:id` (update user)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `DELETE /api/users/:id` (delete user)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `POST /api/users/:id/status` (change status)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `POST /api/users/:id/role` (assign role)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `POST /api/users/:id/password` (change/reset password)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `POST /api/users/:id/avatar` (upload avatar)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `GET /api/users/export` (export users)
- [ ] Add authentication and permissions middleware (role-based access)
- [ ] Add audit logging for all user actions
- [ ] Write unit/integration tests for all endpoints and logic
- [ ] Document API endpoints and expected request/response formats

## 2. Frontend UI & Flows
- [ ] Build user list page using shared `UsersTable` component
- [ ] Fetch users from backend API with pagination, sorting, and filtering
- [ ] Display user avatars, names, emails, roles, statuses, and creation dates
- [ ] Show loading, empty, and error states with clear messaging
- [ ] Integrate `UserStatsCards` for summary metrics (active, pending, suspended, etc.)
- [ ] Add quick filters for status, role, organization, and date range
- [ ] Implement search bar for users (by name, email, ID) with debounce
- [ ] Integrate advanced filters (status, role, org, date range) with URL/query param persistence
- [ ] Add clear/reset filters button
- [ ] Add bulk selection and bulk actions (activate, deactivate, delete, assign role)
- [ ] Implement "Create User" button and dialog with form validation
- [ ] Implement "Edit User" action and dialog with pre-filled data
- [ ] Implement "Change Password" action and dialog with validation
- [ ] Implement "Change Avatar" action and dialog with image upload/preview
- [ ] Implement "Delete User" action (row and bulk) with confirmation dialog
- [ ] Implement "Export Users" action (CSV) for all/selected users
- [ ] Show success/error toasts for all actions
- [ ] Ensure all UI uses shared components and design tokens
- [ ] Ensure all dialogs, forms, and tables are fully accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Add ARIA labels, roles, and descriptions to all controls
- [ ] Support keyboard navigation for all actions
- [ ] Ensure color contrast and focus indicators
- [ ] Add screen reader labels and descriptions
- [ ] Ensure all UI is responsive and mobile-friendly
- [ ] Add touch support for all actions
- [ ] Write unit/integration tests for all UI components and flows
- [ ] Document all UI components and flows in code and markdown

## 3. Integration & State Management
- [ ] Integrate all user actions with backend API (CRUD, search, filters, etc.)
- [ ] Use react-query or equivalent for data fetching and caching
- [ ] Handle API errors gracefully and show user-friendly messages
- [ ] Invalidate and refetch queries on mutation
- [ ] Add tests for API integration and error handling

## 4. Testing & QA
- [ ] Write unit tests for all user components (table, dialogs, forms, actions)
- [ ] Write integration tests for user flows (create, edit, delete, bulk actions)
- [ ] Write E2E tests for critical user journeys
- [ ] Test error states, edge cases, and permission boundaries
- [ ] Test with real and mock data in dev and test environments

## 5. Documentation & Code Quality
- [ ] Document all user management components and flows (in code and markdown)
- [ ] Add usage examples for each component
- [ ] Document API endpoints and expected responses
- [ ] Add troubleshooting and FAQ section for common user issues
- [ ] Ensure all user components are derived from shared UI library
- [ ] Refactor any duplicate or legacy user code
- [ ] Keep all files under 200-300 lines (refactor as needed)
- [ ] Apply SOLID principles and best practices
- [ ] Run lint and build, fix all errors
- [ ] Add/update storybook stories for all user components

*All boxes must be checked before User Management is considered finalized. This checklist is exhaustive and atomic. Each task should be checked off only when fully complete and verified for correctness, security, accessibility, and user experience.*
