# UI Component Library & Enhancement Checklist

## Overview

The UI Component Library is the foundation for all user interfaces in the SaaS platform. Every UI element (Button, Card, Badge, Label, Input, etc.) must be derived from this shared library, ensuring global styling, accessibility, and easy white-labeling. All components must use design tokens, support variants, and be fully documented and tested. Accessibility and responsiveness are first-class requirements.

---

## 1. Design Tokens & Global Styles
- [ ] Audit and document all required design tokens (colors, radii, typography, spacing, shadows, blur)
- [ ] Define/expand color palette (primary, secondary, accent, error, surface, background, border, muted, gradients)
- [ ] Ensure all color pairs meet WCAG 2.0 contrast ratios
- [ ] Add shadow tokens (`--shadow-xs`, `--shadow-md`, `--shadow-lg`)
- [ ] Add blur token (`--blur-md`)
- [ ] Add radii tokens (`--radius-sm`, `--radius-md`, `--radius-lg`)
- [ ] Define typography tokens (font family, sizes, weights, line heights)
- [ ] Define spacing scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40px)
- [ ] Document all tokens in a central markdown file
- [ ] Implement tokens as CSS variables and JS tokens

## 2. Shared Component Implementation

- [ ] Add visible, high-contrast focus state
- [ ] Update Checkbox stories in Storybook for each state
- [ ] Test Checkbox for accessibility

### Switch
- [ ] Refactor Switch to use only tokens for color, border, and radii
- [ ] Add animated toggle and color transitions
- [ ] Ensure large clickable area (min 44x44px)
- [ ] Add visible, high-contrast focus state
- [ ] Update Switch stories in Storybook for each state
- [ ] Test Switch for accessibility

### Separator
- [ ] Refactor Separator to use only tokens for color and thickness
- [ ] Ensure sufficient contrast for all backgrounds
- [ ] Update Separator stories in Storybook for each orientation
- [ ] Test Separator for accessibility

### Table
- [ ] Refactor Table to use only tokens for background, border, and typography
- [ ] Add zebra striping and hover row highlight
- [ ] Add sticky header (optional)
- [ ] Ensure sufficient row height for readability
- [ ] Update Table stories in Storybook for each state
- [ ] Test Table for accessibility and responsiveness

### Avatar
- [ ] Refactor Avatar to use only tokens for border, background, and radii
- [ ] Add border ring and status indicator
- [ ] Ensure fallback initials have accessible color contrast
- [ ] Update Avatar stories in Storybook for each state
- [ ] Test Avatar for accessibility

## 3. Accessibility & Universal Design
- [ ] Set base font size to at least 16px in global CSS
- [ ] Ensure all text and UI elements meet or exceed WCAG 2.0 AA contrast
- [ ] Implement visible, high-contrast focus states for all interactive elements
- [ ] Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard (Tab/Shift+Tab)
- [ ] Add ARIA roles, labels, and descriptions where appropriate
- [ ] Ensure all controls and states are announced by screen readers
- [ ] Ensure all clickable elements have a minimum touch target of 44x44px
- [ ] Make all components responsive for all screen sizes
- [ ] Test all components with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, etc.)
- [ ] Run automated accessibility tests (axe, Lighthouse)

## 4. Documentation & Storybook
- [ ] Ensure all stories use only shared components and design tokens (no custom styles)
- [ ] Add accessibility notes to each story (ARIA, contrast, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Document all component props, variants, and accessibility features in Storybook and markdown
- [ ] Add a design tokens reference story/page in Storybook
- [ ] Add a global accessibility statement in Storybook

## 5. Testing & Review
- [ ] Test all components in Storybook with keyboard navigation

- [ ] Review all color contrast with a contrast checker tool
- [ ] Collect feedback from users with accessibility needs (if possible)
- [ ] Iterate and fix any accessibility or usability issues found

## 6. Finalization
- [ ] Review all documentation in `dev-plan` for completeness and clarity
- [ ] Ensure all code changes are committed and pushed
- [ ] Announce the new UI and accessibility improvements to the team
- [ ] Plan for ongoing accessibility and design reviews in future sprints

*All boxes must be checked before the UI Component Library is considered finalized. This checklist is exhaustive and atomic. Each task should be checked off only when fully complete and verified for accessibility, design, and code quality.*
