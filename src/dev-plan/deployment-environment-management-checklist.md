# Deployment & Environment Management Checklist

## Overview

Robust deployment and environment management are essential for reliability, scalability, and developer productivity. This checklist covers Dockerization, environment variable management, multi-environment configuration, CI/CD, secrets, deployment verification, rollback, and documentation for local, staging, and production environments.

---

## 1. Dockerization & Containerization
- [ ] Create a production-ready `Dockerfile` for the backend API
- [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` for the frontend (React) app
- [ ] Create a `docker-compose.yml` for local development (API, frontend, database, etc.)
- [ ] Add healthcheck instructions to Dockerfiles and compose
- [ ] Optimize Dockerfiles for build caching and small image size
- [ ] Test all services locally using Docker Compose
- [ ] Document Docker usage and troubleshooting

## 2. Environment Variable & Secrets Management
- [ ] Define all required environment variables for each service (API, frontend, DB, etc.)
- [ ] Create `.env.example` files for all services
- [ ] Implement secure secrets management for staging/production (e.g., Docker secrets, Vault, cloud provider)
- [ ] Document environment variable usage and best practices

## 3. Multi-Environment Configuration
- [ ] Set up configuration files for dev, staging, and production
- [ ] Ensure all services can read environment-specific config at runtime
- [ ] Add support for environment-based logging, debugging, and monitoring
- [ ] Test configuration switching between environments

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for lint, build, test, and deploy (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- [ ] Add steps for building and pushing Docker images to a registry
- [ ] Add steps for deploying to staging and production environments
- [ ] Add steps for running database migrations on deploy
- [ ] Add steps for running automated tests in CI/CD
- [ ] Add notifications for build/deploy status
- [ ] Document CI/CD pipeline and troubleshooting

## 5. Deployment Verification & Rollback
- [ ] Implement health checks and readiness probes for all services
- [ ] Add post-deploy verification steps (smoke tests, endpoint checks)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for deployments (e.g., uptime, error rates)
- [ ] Implement rollback strategy for failed deployments
- [ ] Test rollback and recovery procedures
- [ ] Document deployment verification and rollback process

## 6. Local, Staging, and Production Environments
- [ ] Document setup and usage for local development environment
- [ ] Document setup and usage for staging environment
- [ ] Document setup and usage for production environment
- [ ] Add troubleshooting and FAQ section for environment-specific issues

*All boxes must be checked before Deployment & Environment Management is considered finalized. This checklist is exhaustive and atomic. Each task should be checked off only when fully complete and verified for reliability, security, and maintainability.*
