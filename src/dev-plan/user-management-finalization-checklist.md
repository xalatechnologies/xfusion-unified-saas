# User Management Finalization Checklist for `@/saas-admin`

---

## High-Level Overview

The **User Management** feature in the `saas-admin` application provides administrators with a comprehensive interface to manage all users across the SaaS platform. This includes listing, searching, filtering, creating, editing, deleting, and exporting users, as well as managing user roles, statuses, passwords, and avatars. The feature is tightly integrated with the backend API for CRUD operations, leverages a shared UI component library for consistency and branding, and enforces strict access control and validation. All user management logic, UI, and dialogs are encapsulated within the `@/saas-admin` app, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and a seamless admin experience. Accessibility, responsiveness, and code quality are prioritized throughout.

**Relationship to Application Logic:**
- User management is central to the admin's ability to control access, onboard new users, and maintain security and compliance.
- All user actions (create, edit, delete, role/status changes) are reflected in the backend and update the application state via API integration and state management (e.g., react-query).
- The feature interacts with other admin modules (organizations, subscriptions, analytics) for cross-entity management and reporting.
- All UI components must be derived from the shared UI library to ensure global styling and white-labeling support.
