# Database Structure Checklist

## Overview

The database is the backbone of the unified SaaS platform, supporting multi-tenancy, theming, user management, audit logging, and extensibility. This checklist ensures a robust, scalable, and secure schema, with all relationships, constraints, and documentation in place. PostgreSQL is recommended, but the structure should be adaptable to MongoDB if needed.

---

## 1. Schema Design & Planning
- [ ] Define all core entities and their relationships (organizations, users, roles, permissions, design_tokens, etc.)
- [ ] Design ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) for the entire platform
- [ ] Document all table fields, types, and constraints
- [ ] Plan for multi-tenancy (org_id/saas_id patterns, data isolation)
- [ ] Plan for extensibility (custom fields, future modules)
- [ ] Plan for audit logging (entity, action, user, timestamp, details)
- [ ] Review schema for normalization and performance

## 2. Core Tables & Fields
- [ ] Create `organizations` table (id, name, slug, status, created_at, updated_at)
- [ ] Create `users` table (id, org_id, email, first_name, last_name, role, status, password_hash, avatar_url, created_at, updated_at)
- [ ] Create `roles` table (id, name, description, permissions)
- [ ] Create `permissions` table (id, key, description)
- [ ] Create `user_roles` join table (user_id, role_id)
- [ ] Create `design_tokens` table (id, org_id, saas_id, token_key, token_value, token_type, enum_key, updated_at)
- [ ] Create `design_token_enums` table (id, enum_type, enum_key, enum_value, description)
- [ ] Create `audit_logs` table (id, entity, entity_id, action, user_id, timestamp, details)
- [ ] Add any additional tables required for future features (e.g., subscriptions, analytics)

## 3. Relationships, Indexes & Constraints
- [ ] Add foreign keys for all relationships (e.g., users.org_id â†’ organizations.id)
- [ ] Add unique constraints (e.g., unique email per org, unique token_key per org/saas)
- [ ] Add indexes for all lookup fields (e.g., org_id, email, token_key)
- [ ] Add check constraints for enum fields (e.g., status, role)
- [ ] Add cascading rules for deletes/updates (e.g., delete users when org is deleted)
- [ ] Test referential integrity for all relationships

## 4. Multi-Tenancy & Security
- [ ] Ensure all tables support org_id/saas_id for data isolation
- [ ] Add row-level security policies (if supported by DB)
- [ ] Test data isolation between orgs/saas
- [ ] Document multi-tenancy patterns and best practices

## 5. Migrations & Seed Data
- [ ] Write migration scripts for all tables and relationships
- [ ] Write seed scripts for initial data (admin user, default org, default tokens, roles, permissions)
- [ ] Test migrations on clean and existing databases
- [ ] Document migration and seeding process

## 6. Audit Logging & Extensibility
- [ ] Implement audit logging triggers or logic for all critical actions (create, update, delete)
- [ ] Ensure audit_logs table captures all required fields
- [ ] Test audit logging for all entities
- [ ] Plan and document how to add new tables/modules in the future

## 7. Documentation & Review
- [ ] Generate and maintain ERD diagrams
- [ ] Document schema, relationships, and constraints in markdown
- [ ] Document all migration and seed scripts
- [ ] Review schema with team and update as needed
- [ ] Add troubleshooting and FAQ section for common DB issues

*All boxes must be checked before the database structure is considered finalized. This checklist is exhaustive and atomic. Each task should be checked off only when fully complete and verified for correctness, security, and extensibility.*
