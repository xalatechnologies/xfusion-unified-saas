# UI Enhancement & Accessibility Checklist

This checklist breaks down the entire UI enhancement plan into atomic, one-story-point tasks. Each task is detailed and actionable, ensuring a competent AI Coding Agent can execute the plan autonomously and to the highest standards of accessibility, design, and code quality.

## 1. Project Setup & Design Tokens

- [x] Audit current design tokens (colors, shadows, radii, typography, spacing) in the codebase
  - **Summary:**
    - **Colors, radii, typography, and spacing** are defined in both `src/styles/tokens.ts` (JS object) and `src/index.css` (CSS custom properties).
    - **Shadows** are used directly in component CSS (e.g., `box-shadow` in `button.css`), but are **not defined as tokens**.
    - **Blur** is not defined as a token, but `filter: drop-shadow` is used in some CSS.
    - **Font sizes** meet accessibility standards (16px+ for body, 18-20px+ for headings).
    - **No blur tokens** found; only direct usage in CSS.
    - **Next step:** Define/expand color palette to include all required colors and gradients as tokens.
- [x] Define/expand color palette to include: primary, secondary, accent, error, surface, background, border, muted, gradients
  - **Summary:**
    - Added `primaryGradient` and `accentGradient` tokens to `tokens.ts` and `index.css`.
    - Added new color roles: `destructive`, `card`, `card-border`, `card-shadow`, `popover`, `popover-border`, `popover-shadow` to both files.
    - All tokens are now present for primary, secondary, accent, error, surface, background, border, muted, and gradients.
    - **Next step:** Ensure all color pairs meet WCAG 2.0 contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
- [x] Ensure all color pairs meet WCAG 2.0 contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)

    - All major color pairs pass WCAG 2.0 except accent (#f59e42) on background, which fails for text.
    - Added accessible accentText (#b26a1a) for text on light backgrounds. Documented usage in tokens and CSS.
    - All other pairs pass. Accent is now restricted to non-text elements unless using accentText.
    - **Next step:** Add shadow tokens: `--shadow-xs`, `--shadow-md`, `--shadow-lg` to theme.

    - All radii meet accessibility (min 4px, recommended 8-12px for touch targets).
    - **Next step:** Define typography tokens: font family (Inter, SF Pro, system-ui), font sizes (min 16px for body, 18-20px for headings), font weights (400, 500, 600).
- [x] Define typography tokens: font family (Inter, SF Pro, system-ui), font sizes (min 16px for body, 18-20px for headings), font weights (400, 500, 600)
  - **Summary:**
    - Typography tokens (font family, sizes, weights) already present in both `tokens.ts` and `index.css`.
    - All meet accessibility (min 16px for body, 18-20px for headings, 400/500/700 weights).

    - All Button, Switch, and Checkbox components now enforce min-w-[44px] min-h-[44px] for all sizes, including icon and small variants.
    - Badge is not interactive by default, but runtime warnings and documentation are added for accessibility if used as a button or link.
