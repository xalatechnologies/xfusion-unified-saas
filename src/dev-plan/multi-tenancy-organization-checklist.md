# Multi-Tenancy & Organization Management Checklist

## Overview

Multi-tenancy and organization management enable the SaaS platform to securely support multiple organizations (tenants) with isolated data, custom branding, and delegated administration. This feature covers org/saas-level data separation, organization CRUD, membership management, role assignment, org switching, and all related security and edge cases.

---

## 1. Backend & Database
- [ ] Design and document the `organizations` table schema (fields, constraints, unique slug, etc.)
- [ ] Implement DB migrations for organizations and related tables (org membership, org settings, etc.)
- [ ] Implement backend logic for organization CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
- [ ] Implement backend logic for org membership (invite, join, leave, remove)
- [ ] Implement backend logic for org role assignment (admin, member, custom roles)
- [ ] Implement backend logic for org switching (current org context per user)
- [ ] Implement backend logic for org-level settings and overrides (branding, tokens, etc.)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `GET /api/organizations` (list/search orgs for user)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `POST /api/organizations` (create org)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `PUT /api/organizations/:id` (update org)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `DELETE /api/organizations/:id` (delete org)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `POST /api/organizations/:id/invite` (invite user)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `POST /api/organizations/:id/members` (add/remove member)
- [ ] Implement API endpoint: `POST /api/organizations/:id/role` (assign org role)
- [ ] Add authentication and permissions middleware (org/saas-level access)
- [ ] Add audit logging for all org actions
- [ ] Write unit/integration tests for all endpoints and logic
- [ ] Document API endpoints and expected request/response formats

## 2. Frontend UI & Flows
- [ ] Build organization list and switcher UI (current org context, dropdown, etc.)
- [ ] Build organization CRUD UI (create, edit, delete org)
- [ ] Build org membership management UI (invite, join, leave, remove members)
- [ ] Build org role assignment UI (admin, member, custom roles)
- [ ] Show org-level settings and branding controls
- [ ] Show org context in all relevant UI (sidebar, topbar, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure all org actions use shared components and design tokens
- [ ] Ensure all org actions are accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Add ARIA labels, roles, and descriptions to all controls
- [ ] Support keyboard navigation for all org actions
- [ ] Ensure color contrast and focus indicators
- [ ] Add screen reader labels and descriptions
- [ ] Ensure all UI is responsive and mobile-friendly
- [ ] Add touch support for all org actions
- [ ] Write unit/integration tests for all UI components and flows
- [ ] Document all UI components and flows in code and markdown

## 3. Security & Data Isolation
- [ ] Ensure all org data is isolated by org_id/saas_id in all queries
- [ ] Add row-level security policies (if supported by DB)
- [ ] Test data isolation between orgs/saas
- [ ] Add tests for permission boundaries and edge cases
- [ ] Document multi-tenancy patterns and best practices

## 4. Testing & QA
- [ ] Write unit tests for all org components and backend logic
- [ ] Write integration tests for org flows (CRUD, membership, switching)
- [ ] Write E2E tests for critical org journeys
- [ ] Test error states, edge cases, and permission boundaries
- [ ] Test with real and mock data in dev and test environments

## 5. Documentation & Code Quality
- [ ] Document all org management components and flows (in code and markdown)
- [ ] Add usage examples for each component
- [ ] Document API endpoints and expected responses
- [ ] Add troubleshooting and FAQ section for common org issues
- [ ] Ensure all org components are derived from shared UI library
- [ ] Refactor any duplicate or legacy org code
- [ ] Keep all files under 200-300 lines (refactor as needed)
- [ ] Apply SOLID principles and best practices
- [ ] Run lint and build, fix all errors
- [ ] Add/update storybook stories for all org components
