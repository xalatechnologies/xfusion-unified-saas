# API & Backend Architecture Checklist

## Overview

The API and backend architecture provide the foundation for all business logic, data access, and security in the SaaS platform. Built with .NET Core, it uses the Repository Pattern and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for maintainability, testability, and scalability. This checklist covers project structure, API design, authentication, authorization, error handling, and extensibility.

---

## 1. Project Structure & Setup
- [ ] Scaffold ASP.NET Core Web API project
- [ ] Implement layered architecture (API, Application, Domain, Infrastructure)
- [ ] Set up dependency injection and configuration
- [ ] Add logging and error handling middleware
- [ ] Configure environment-based settings (dev, test, prod)
- [ ] Document project structure and conventions

## 2. Repository Pattern & DDD
- [ ] Define domain models for all core entities (User, Organization, Role, Token, etc.)
- [ ] Implement repositories for all entities (CRUD, queries, etc.)
- [ ] Implement application services for business logic
- [ ] Use MediatR for CQRS if complexity grows
- [ ] Add unit/integration tests for repositories and services
- [ ] Document DDD patterns and repository usage

## 3. API Design & Endpoints
- [ ] Design RESTful API endpoints for all entities (users, orgs, tokens, etc.)
- [ ] Implement versioning for all endpoints
- [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] Add request/response validation and error handling
- [ ] Implement pagination, filtering, and sorting for list endpoints
- [ ] Add rate limiting and throttling
- [ ] Document all endpoints and expected formats

## 4. Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Implement JWT/OAuth2 authentication
- [ ] Add user registration, login, logout endpoints
- [ ] Implement password hashing and reset flows
- [ ] Add role-based access control (RBAC) for all endpoints
- [ ] Add org/saas-level permission checks
- [ ] Add audit logging for all auth and permission events
- [ ] Write tests for all auth and permission logic
- [ ] Document authentication and authorization flows

## 5. Error Handling & Security
- [ ] Implement global error handling middleware
- [ ] Add structured error responses (problem+json)
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Add security headers and CORS configuration
- [ ] Add logging for all errors and security events
- [ ] Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- [ ] Document error handling and security best practices

## 6. Extensibility & Maintenance
- [ ] Plan for future modules and extensibility (subscriptions, analytics, etc.)
- [ ] Add health check and monitoring endpoints
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for backend (build, test, deploy)
- [ ] Document deployment and maintenance processes

## 7. Testing & QA
- [ ] Write unit tests for all business logic and repositories
- [ ] Write integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Write E2E tests for critical backend flows
- [ ] Test error states, edge cases, and permission boundaries
- [ ] Test with real and mock data in dev and test environments

## 8. Documentation & Code Quality
- [ ] Document all backend components and flows (in code and markdown)
- [ ] Add usage examples for each service/repository
- [ ] Add troubleshooting and FAQ section for common backend issues
- [ ] Refactor any duplicate or legacy backend code
- [ ] Keep all files under 200-300 lines (refactor as needed)
- [ ] Apply SOLID principles and best practices
- [ ] Run lint and build, fix all errors

*All boxes must be checked before API & Backend Architecture is considered finalized. This checklist is exhaustive and atomic. Each task should be checked off only when fully complete and verified for correctness, security, and maintainability.*
