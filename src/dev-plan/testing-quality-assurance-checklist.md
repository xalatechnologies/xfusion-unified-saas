# Testing & Quality Assurance Checklist

## Overview

Comprehensive testing and quality assurance are essential for reliability, security, and user trust. This checklist covers unit, integration, E2E, visual, and accessibility testing; test environment setup; test data management; coverage and quality gates; CI/CD integration; and documentation for all tools and flows.

---

## 1. Testing Strategy & Planning
- [ ] Define overall testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E, visual, accessibility)
- [ ] Select and document testing tools (Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright/Cypress, axe, etc.)
- [ ] Define test coverage goals and quality gates
- [ ] Document test plan and strategy in markdown

## 2. Unit Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for all backend business logic and repositories
- [ ] Write unit tests for all API endpoints (controllers, services)
- [ ] Write unit tests for all shared UI components
- [ ] Write unit tests for all frontend utilities and hooks
- [ ] Ensure all unit tests are fast, isolated, and repeatable
- [ ] Add unit test coverage reporting

## 3. Integration Testing
- [ ] Write integration tests for backend flows (API + DB)
- [ ] Write integration tests for frontend flows (components + API)
- [ ] Test all critical user journeys (auth, CRUD, permissions, etc.)
- [ ] Add integration test coverage reporting

## 4. End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- [ ] Set up E2E testing framework (Playwright, Cypress, etc.)
- [ ] Write E2E tests for all critical user flows (login, dashboard, CRUD, theming, etc.)
- [ ] Test across all supported browsers and devices
- [ ] Add E2E tests to CI/CD pipeline

## 5. Visual Regression Testing
- [ ] Set up visual regression testing tool (Chromatic, Percy, etc.)
- [ ] Capture baseline screenshots for all UI states and breakpoints
- [ ] Run visual regression tests on all UI changes
- [ ] Review and resolve visual diffs before merging

## 6. Accessibility Testing
- [ ] Run automated accessibility tests (axe, Lighthouse) on all pages and flows
- [ ] Write manual accessibility test cases for all critical flows
- [ ] Test all layouts and flows with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS)
- [ ] Document accessibility test results and known issues

## 7. Test Environment & Data Management
- [ ] Set up dedicated test environments (local, CI, staging)
- [ ] Manage test data, fixtures, and mocks for all services
- [ ] Ensure test data is isolated and reset between runs
- [ ] Document test environment setup and usage

## 8. Coverage, Reporting & Quality Gates
- [ ] Enforce code coverage thresholds in CI/CD
- [ ] Add test result reporting to CI/CD (badges, dashboards, notifications)
- [ ] Block merges on failed tests or insufficient coverage
- [ ] Review test flakiness and address unstable tests

## 9. CI/CD Integration
- [ ] Run all tests (unit, integration, E2E, visual, accessibility) in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Run tests on all supported environments (Node versions, browsers, OS)
- [ ] Add notifications for test failures and coverage drops
- [ ] Document CI/CD test integration and troubleshooting

## 10. Documentation & Troubleshooting
- [ ] Document all test suites, tools, and flows in markdown
- [ ] Add troubleshooting and FAQ section for common test issues
- [ ] Provide training/guides for writing and maintaining tests
- [ ] Schedule regular test review and maintenance

*All boxes must be checked before Testing & Quality Assurance is considered finalized. This checklist is exhaustive and atomic. Each task should be checked off only when fully complete and verified for reliability, coverage, and maintainability.*
