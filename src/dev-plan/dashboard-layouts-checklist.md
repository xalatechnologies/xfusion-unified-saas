# Dashboard & Layouts Feature Checklist

## Overview

Dashboards and layouts provide the structural foundation for all app experiences, including navigation (sidebar, topbar), content areas, and responsive design. This feature covers the implementation of modern, elegant, and accessible layouts inspired by Apple/Linear/Stripe, with full support for theming, white-labeling, and mobile responsiveness.

- [ ] Define layout variants (admin, org, user, minimal, etc.)
- [ ] Plan for responsive breakpoints and mobile-first design
- [ ] Document layout requirements and user flows

## 2. Sidebar Implementation
- [ ] Build shared Sidebar component using design tokens
- [ ] Implement navigation links, icons, and active state
- [ ] Add support for nested navigation and collapsible sections
- [ ] Add organization/user context (logo, name, avatar)
- [ ] Add responsive behavior (collapse, drawer, mobile slide-in)
- [ ] Ensure sidebar is accessible (keyboard, ARIA roles, focus management)
- [ ] Add high-contrast focus indicators
- [ ] Test sidebar with screen readers
- [ ] Document sidebar props, variants, and usage

## 3. Topbar Implementation
- [ ] Build shared Topbar component using design tokens
- [ ] Add organization/user context (logo, name, avatar, org switcher)
- [ ] Add navigation links, notifications, and actions (search, settings, etc.)
- [ ] Add responsive behavior (collapse, overflow menu, mobile)
- [ ] Ensure topbar is accessible (keyboard, ARIA roles, focus management)
- [ ] Add high-contrast focus indicators
- [ ] Test topbar with screen readers
- [ ] Document topbar props, variants, and usage

## 4. Content & Layout Variants
- [ ] Implement main content area with padding, max-width, and responsive scaling
- [ ] Add support for cards, tables, and widgets in content area
- [ ] Implement layout variants (admin, org, user, minimal, etc.)
- [ ] Add support for theming and white-labeling in all layouts
- [ ] Ensure all layouts are accessible and responsive
- [ ] Test all layouts on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [ ] Document layout variants and usage

## 5. Integration & Theming
- [ ] Integrate sidebar, topbar, and content area into main layout shell
- [ ] Ensure all layout components use shared design tokens and theming
- [ ] Add support for runtime theme switching (org/saas/global)
- [ ] Test integration with theming admin panel
- [ ] Document integration process for devs

## 6. Accessibility & Responsiveness
- [ ] Ensure all layout components meet WCAG 2.0 AA standards
- [ ] Add ARIA roles, labels, and descriptions to all layout elements
- [ ] Support keyboard navigation for all layout actions
- [ ] Ensure color contrast and focus indicators
- [ ] Test all layouts with screen readers
- [ ] Make all layouts fully responsive for all breakpoints
- [ ] Add touch support for all layout actions

## 7. Testing & QA
- [ ] Write unit tests for all layout components (sidebar, topbar, content)
- [ ] Write integration tests for layout flows (navigation, switching, theming)
- [ ] Write E2E tests for critical dashboard journeys
- [ ] Test error states, edge cases, and permission boundaries
- [ ] Test with real and mock data in dev and test environments

## 8. Documentation & Code Quality
- [ ] Document all layout components and flows (in code and markdown)
- [ ] Add usage examples for each component
- [ ] Add troubleshooting and FAQ section for common layout issues
- [ ] Ensure all layout components are derived from shared UI library
